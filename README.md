Personal notebook of my study of "Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction" by Kevin P. Murphy

## Please check!!
All documents in this repository are written with '.ipynb' extension, stands for 'ipython notebook'.
However, Github occasionally fails to render ipynb document properly. Rendering is slow and some contents are wrongly written (especailly for latex equations) or even missing.

Thus, I provide 'nbviewer' URL of each .ipynb files in this repository here. If github fails to render files properly, please click the link below for corrosponding ipynb file:
